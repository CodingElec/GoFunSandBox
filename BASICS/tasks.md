HANDS ON 1
- create a type square
- create a type circle
- attach a method to each that calculates area and returns it
- create a type shape which defines an interface as anything which has the area method
- create a func info which takes type shape and then prints the area
- create a value of type square
- create a value of type circle
- use func info to print the area of square
- use func info to print the area of circle
SOLUTION

HANDS ON 2
- create a struct that holds person fields
- create a struct that holds secret agent fields and embeds person type
- attach a method to person: pSpeak
- attach a method to secret agent: saSpeak
- create a variable of type person
- create a variable of type secret agent
- print a field from person
- run pSpeak attached to the variable of type person
- print a field from secret agent
- run saSpeak attached to the variable of type secret agent
- run pSpeak attached to the variable of type secret agent
SOLUTION

HANDS ON 3
- create an interface type that both person and secretAgent implement
- declare a func with a parameter of the interface’s type
- call that func in main and pass in a value of type person
- call that func in main and pass in a value of type secretAgent
SOLUTION
